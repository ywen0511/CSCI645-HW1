# In-Hand Cube Rotation with LEAP Hand

<!-- TODO: Add badges here (License, DOI, etc.) -->

This repository contains Reinforcement Learning (RL) environments for in-hand cube rotation with the LEAP hand. The environments are built using the [MjLab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab) framework and MuJoCo physics engine.

The videos above show a trained policy rotating a cube in simulation (left) and on the real LEAP hand (right). The policy is trained using domain randomization and asymmetric actor-critic to enable robust sim-to-real transfer.

**Built on prior work:** This implementation is based on the task design and reward formulations from [HORA](https://github.com/haozhiqi/hora) and uses robot models from [LEAP Hand Sim](https://github.com/leap-hand/LEAP_Hand_Sim). We re-implement these methods using the [MjLab](https://github.com/mujocolab/mjlab) framework to provide a modular, extensible codebase for in-hand manipulation research. We thank the authors of these prior works for their excellent contributions to the field!

## Overview

This repository implements a complete sim-to-real pipeline for in-hand manipulation:

- **Three LEAP hand embodiments**: right, left, and custom left hand variants
- **Asymmetric actor-critic**: Noisy, delayed proprioception for the actor; full state for the critic
- **Curriculum learning**: Penalties scale with rotation progress to enable gradual skill acquisition
- **Domain randomization**: Cube properties, contact dynamics, and actuator parameters randomized for robust sim-to-real transfer
- **Hardware deployment**: ZMQ-based policy server for real-time inference on physical hardware

The implementation supports **grasp cache generation**, **parallel training** (multi-GPU), **sim2sim testing**, **trajectory replay**, and **system identification** for actuator parameter fitting.

## Install

To install the repository, you need the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager. If you don't have it yet, install it by following the instructions [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Clone this repository and run:

```bash
cd ~/projects/in-hand-rotation-mjlab

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

---

**See [PIPELINE.md](PIPELINE.md) for the complete sim-to-real deployment pipeline**, including:
- Grasp cache generation
- Sim2sim deployment testing
- Policy server setup
- Trajectory recording and replay
- System identification for actuator calibration

---

**Real-world setup:** see [`real_world/README.md`](real_world/README.md) for the Docker-based ROS runtime, deployment client, and sys-id collection commands.

## Using a Pre-Trained Agent

You can use a pre-trained agent directly in the MjLab environment to see the cube rotation behavior:

```bash
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/<experiment_name>/<timestamp>/model_*.pt
```

This repo also includes a sample checkpoint:

- `ckpts/leap_left_custom_model_4900.pt` (task: `Mjlab-Leap-Left-Custom-HandCube-Rotate`)

Example:

```bash
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-Custom-HandCube-Rotate \
  --checkpoint-file ckpts/leap_left_custom_model_4900.pt
```

To test the environment with random actions before training:

```bash
# Random actions
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate --agent random

# Zero actions (observe passive dynamics)
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate --agent zero
```

---

## Training Your Own Agent

You can customize the environments and train your own policies. Environment configurations are located at `src/in_hand_rotation_mjlab/tasks/hand_cube/config/<embodiment>/`.

### Test the Environment

Before training, verify the environment setup:

```bash
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate --agent random
```

### Start Training

Train using parallel environments (GPU recommended):

```bash
uv run python scripts/train.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate --env.scene.num-envs 4096
```

This uses 4096 parallel environments for efficient training. Checkpoints are saved to `logs/rsl_rl/<experiment_name>/<timestamp>/`.

### Multi-GPU Training

For multi-GPU training:

```bash
uv run python scripts/train.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate --gpu-ids all
```

### Play Trained Policy

Once training completes, evaluate the trained policy:

```bash
uv run python scripts/play.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/<experiment_name>/<timestamp>/model_*.pt
```

## Deploying to Real Hardware

For hardware deployment, we provide a ZMQ-based policy server that runs inference and communicates with the physical LEAP hand controller.

For real hardware runtime/container setup, command launch, and system identification collection, see [`real_world/README.md`](real_world/README.md).

Start the policy server:

```bash
uv run python scripts/policy_server_zmq.py Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate \
  --checkpoint-file logs/rsl_rl/<experiment_name>/<timestamp>/model_*.pt \
  --bind tcp://0.0.0.0:5555
```

The server processes observations from hardware and returns joint position commands at 20 Hz.

## Available Tasks

| Task ID | Robot | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `Mjlab-Leap-Right-HandCube-Rotate` | LEAP Right | Right-handed cube rotation |
| `Mjlab-Leap-Left-HandCube-Rotate` | LEAP Left | Left-handed cube rotation |
| `Mjlab-Leap-Left-Custom-HandCube-Rotate` | LEAP Left Custom | Custom left hand variant |

Each task can be customized independently via robot-specific parameters (grasp pose, spawn position, cache file) and shared configuration (observations, rewards, domain randomization).

---

## Key Design Choices

### Observations
- **Actor** (deployed on hardware): Noisy, delayed joint positions (history=10) and commanded positions
- **Critic** (training only): Full state including cube pose/velocity and physical parameters

### Actions
- Joint position delta: ±1/24 rad/step at 20 Hz control frequency

### Rewards
- Rotation progress (drift-gated to penalize unwanted axis rotation)
- Penalties: linear velocity, pose deviation, torque, work
- Curriculum: penalties scale with rotation progress for gradual learning

### Domain Randomization
- **Cube**: mass, size, center of mass, friction
- **Contacts**: hand-cube friction coefficients
- **Actuators**: friction, damping, PD gains, effort limits, control delays

This enables robust policies that transfer from simulation to real hardware.
